# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Technology
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the core enabler behind the Travel Planner Agent’s intelligence. It allows the system to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language responses, making interactions intuitive and human-friendly.

The system uses a combination of IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Granite foundation models (accessed via Watsonx.ai) to power all its NLP tasks.

🔑 Key NLP Capabilities Used
1. Intent Detection
Goal: Understand the user’s purpose or question.

How it works: Watson Assistant uses trained intents (e.g., plan_trip, budget_inquiry, weather_check) to classify the user’s input.

Example:

User input: “I want to go to Bali next month.”

Detected intent: plan_trip

2. Entity Extraction
Goal: Identify key parameters or slots from user input such as:

Destination (e.g., “Bali”)

Budget (e.g., “under $1000”)

Duration (e.g., “7 days”)

Dates (e.g., “next month”)

How it works:

Watson Assistant uses entity recognition.

Granite models assist in resolving ambiguous expressions (e.g., “next weekend” → actual dates).

3. Text Generation
Goal: Automatically create:

Itineraries

Recommendations

Summaries of places and travel rules

How it works:

The granite-3-3b-8-instruct model generates coherent, creative, and personalized travel outputs.

Example:

Prompt: “Create a 3-day itinerary for Rome”

Output: Structured daily plan including landmarks, times, and food spots.

4. Dialogue Context Tracking
Goal: Maintain natural, continuous conversations across multiple turns.

How it works:

Watson Assistant uses context variables.

LangGraph stores conversation state and passes context-aware prompts to Granite.

Example:

User: “Book that for 3 people.”

System remembers previous turn referred to “trip to Rome on Oct 10th.”
 What is LangGraph?
LangGraph is an open-source Python framework developed by LangChain that allows developers to build stateful, multi-agent, and graph-structured applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It is specifically designed to:

Handle complex reasoning workflows involving LLMs.

Enable long-term memory and persistent state.

Manage modular, dynamic task orchestration in AI applications.

LangGraph treats the overall process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where:

Each node is a function, agent, or LLM call.

Edges define the logic for what happens next based on results or events.

# 🧠 Why LangGraph for This Project?
The Travel Planner Agent is not just a chatbot. It requires multi-step reasoning, data fetching, memory, and conditional task routing. LangGraph is ideal for this because it allows you to:

✅ Build Stateful, Memory-Aware Workflows
LangGraph tracks conversation history and state variables across multiple steps:

User: "Plan a trip to Paris in October"

Agent remembers that the destination is Paris and the month is October in all future responses, even if the user says, “Make it 5 days long” in the next turn.

✅ Implement Multi-Step Planning Logic
For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
User Input →
→ Intent Recognition →
→ Entity Extraction →
→ Weather API Check →
→ Granite Model Call for Itinerary →
→ Booking Recommendation →
→ Summary Generation
Each of these steps is a node in the graph, and transitions are controlled dynamically based on user input and LLM output.

✅ Integrate with Tools & Services
LangGraph works well with:

Granite Models via API (Watsonx)

IBM Cloud Functions for external services

IBM Cloudant for state persistence

Watson Assistant for front-end chat interface

✅ Support Event-Driven & Async Behavior
For example:

If a flight gets delayed (external webhook), LangGraph can trigger a schedule change.

If weather data shows storms, LangGraph can re-route the itinerary.
# IBM Granite Model – granite-3-3b-8-instruct
📌 Overview
granite-3-3b-8-instruct is part of IBM's Granite family of foundation models, developed to support a wide range of enterprise-grade AI use cases. It is a 3.3 billion parameter, instruction-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for natural language understanding (NLU) and text generation.

This model is hosted and accessible via IBM Watsonx.ai, IBM’s AI and data platform for developing, governing, and deploying trusted AI.
