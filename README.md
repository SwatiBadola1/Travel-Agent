# Travel-Agent
‚ú® Overview
The Travel Planner Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to intelligently and efficiently assist users in planning their trips. The solution transforms the complex, often overwhelming process of travel planning into a smooth, personalized, and enjoyable experience.

Leveraging real-time data and user-centric AI capabilities, the agent performs a variety of functions ranging from destination recommendations to dynamic itinerary building, real-time travel alerts, and even automated booking management.

üß† Core Features
Personalized Trip Planning
Understands user preferences, travel goals, budget, travel dates, and constraints to create highly customized travel itineraries.

Destination Discovery
Recommends destinations based on interests (e.g., beaches, hiking, history, food), budget, travel restrictions, and seasonal considerations.

Smart Itinerary Builder
Builds daily plans, factoring in distances, transport options, weather conditions, and local event timings.

Accommodation & Transport Suggestions
Recommends flights, trains, car rentals, and hotels based on real-time availability and user budget.

Live Alerts & Rebooking Options
Notifies users of flight delays, weather disruptions, or schedule conflicts and suggests on-the-fly alternatives.

Integrated Local Insights
Suggests local guides, must-visit places, hidden gems, cultural etiquettes, and dining spots, powered by maps and guide APIs.

Multimodal Interaction
Interact via chat or voice for ease of use and accessibility.

‚òÅÔ∏è Technologies Used
This project mandates the use of IBM Cloud Lite Services and IBM Granite foundation models. Here's how they're integrated:

IBM Cloud Lite Services
IBM Watson Assistant
Used to power the natural language interface, enabling conversational interaction between the user and the travel planner agent.

IBM Cloud Functions
Used to run backend logic such as fetching weather data, processing API calls to third-party services (e.g., airlines, hotels), and orchestrating workflows.

IBM Cloudant
Used to store user profiles, saved trips, preferences, and itinerary data.

IBM Weather Company Data (Lite)
Provides real-time weather forecasts used in travel plan optimization.

IBM AppID (Optional)
Handles user authentication for saving travel preferences and syncing across devices.

IBM Granite Models
Granite Code/Granite NLP Foundation Models
These state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models) are used to:

Understand complex user inputs (natural language queries).

Generate travel itineraries dynamically.

Summarize destination information.

Offer contextual responses based on real-world travel data.

Note: All AI tasks, such as NLP understanding and itinerary generation, are powered through the IBM Granite models hosted on IBM Cloud.
