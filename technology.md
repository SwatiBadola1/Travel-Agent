# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Technology
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the core enabler behind the Travel Planner Agent’s intelligence. It allows the system to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language responses, making interactions intuitive and human-friendly.

The system uses a combination of IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Granite foundation models (accessed via Watsonx.ai) to power all its NLP tasks.

🔑 Key NLP Capabilities Used
1. Intent Detection
Goal: Understand the user’s purpose or question.

How it works: Watson Assistant uses trained intents (e.g., plan_trip, budget_inquiry, weather_check) to classify the user’s input.

Example:

User input: “I want to go to Bali next month.”

Detected intent: plan_trip

2. Entity Extraction
Goal: Identify key parameters or slots from user input such as:

Destination (e.g., “Bali”)

Budget (e.g., “under $1000”)

Duration (e.g., “7 days”)

Dates (e.g., “next month”)

How it works:

Watson Assistant uses entity recognition.

Granite models assist in resolving ambiguous expressions (e.g., “next weekend” → actual dates).

3. Text Generation
Goal: Automatically create:

Itineraries

Recommendations

Summaries of places and travel rules

How it works:

The granite-3-3b-8-instruct model generates coherent, creative, and personalized travel outputs.

Example:

Prompt: “Create a 3-day itinerary for Rome”

Output: Structured daily plan including landmarks, times, and food spots.

4. Dialogue Context Tracking
Goal: Maintain natural, continuous conversations across multiple turns.

How it works:

Watson Assistant uses context variables.

LangGraph stores conversation state and passes context-aware prompts to Granite.

Example:

User: “Book that for 3 people.”

System remembers previous turn referred to “trip to Rome on Oct 10th.”
 What is LangGraph?
LangGraph is an open-source Python framework developed by LangChain that allows developers to build stateful, multi-agent, and graph-structured applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It is specifically designed to:

Handle complex reasoning workflows involving LLMs.

Enable long-term memory and persistent state.

Manage modular, dynamic task orchestration in AI applications.

LangGraph treats the overall process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where:

Each node is a function, agent, or LLM call.

Edges define the logic for what happens next based on results or events.

# 🧠 Why LangGraph for This Project?
The Travel Planner Agent is not just a chatbot. It requires multi-step reasoning, data fetching, memory, and conditional task routing. LangGraph is ideal for this because it allows you to:

✅ Build Stateful, Memory-Aware Workflows
LangGraph tracks conversation history and state variables across multiple steps:

User: "Plan a trip to Paris in October"

Agent remembers that the destination is Paris and the month is October in all future responses, even if the user says, “Make it 5 days long” in the next turn.

✅ Implement Multi-Step Planning Logic
For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
User Input →
→ Intent Recognition →
→ Entity Extraction →
→ Weather API Check →
→ Granite Model Call for Itinerary →
→ Booking Recommendation →
→ Summary Generation
Each of these steps is a node in the graph, and transitions are controlled dynamically based on user input and LLM output.

✅ Integrate with Tools & Services
LangGraph works well with:

Granite Models via API (Watsonx)

IBM Cloud Functions for external services

IBM Cloudant for state persistence

Watson Assistant for front-end chat interface

✅ Support Event-Driven & Async Behavior
For example:

If a flight gets delayed (external webhook), LangGraph can trigger a schedule change.

If weather data shows storms, LangGraph can re-route the itinerary.
